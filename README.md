# Console-Based-Notepad
A custom notepad built in C++ using a 2D linked list for text storage, supporting character-level insertion, deletion, cursor navigation, and undo/redo using stacks. Inspired by real text editors, with a visible window layout and future-ready UI zones for search and suggestions.
